| instanceGUID             | **string.** A globally unique ID (GUID) that identifies this specific Order Management System. When creating an OMS, you can assign this GUID directly (it must be unique) or you can leave this value set to an empty string and allow the system to assign the GUID. |
| assetManagerCoreId       | **string.** This is a name that is set during configuration of the venue. |
| assetManagerCoreUser     | **string.** The named user who has access to the asset manager *core* for the Order Management System. This name is set during configuration of the venue. |

| marginEnabled            | **Boolean.** If this value is *true,* then margin trading is enabled on this Order Management System. **Note:** Margin trading calls are a future feature of the Bitpoint Latam  Exchange. Setting this value to *true* signifies that margin trading is enabled for when it becomes available, not that margin trading can take place now. |
| marginMarketType         | **integer.** An integer that describes the margin market type available on this Order Management System. One of:<br />**0** None<br />**1** Provider &mdash; The venue extends credit to the investor for trading.<br />**2** SwapMarket &mdash; A *swap* is a derivative contract.

You should set this value to 0 until that function is available.  |
