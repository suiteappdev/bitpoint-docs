## RemoveOperatorOMS

**Category:** System<br />**Permissions:** Operator<br />**Call Type:** Synchronous

*Unassigns* an existing user with Operator permission from being the operator of an existing Order Management System. The Operator retains his Operator permission; but he is no longer able to manage the specific Order Management System. The Operator retains his user status otherwise.

To remove a permission from a user (even an Operator permission), use **RevokeUserPermission.** You cannot remove a user from an Exchange once he is registered. However, you can prevent login by using the **SetUserInfo** call to set the value of *emailVerified* to *false.*

To set an operator for a specific OMS, call **SetDefaultOperatorOMS.**
