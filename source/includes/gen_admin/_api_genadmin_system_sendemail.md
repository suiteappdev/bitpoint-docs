| defaultTimeZone | **string.** The default time zone in which the email is date-and-time-stamped, regardless of where the SUPERUSER is logged in. This can be any time zone. However, all date&ndash; and time-stamps in the Bitpoint Latam  exchange are recorded as UTC. |

| toAddresses     | **array of strings.** This is an array of email addresses to which the email will be sent. |
| bccAddresses    | **array of strings.** This is an array of email addresses to which the email will be sent without a record in the message header. |
