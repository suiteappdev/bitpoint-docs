## CoinsOAuthAuthenticateUser	

**Category:** System<br />**Permissions:** Public<br />**Call Type:** Synchronous

Authenticates a user to the Exchange by accepting OAuth information.

The Bitpoint Latam  Exchange communicates internally with the client system that uses OAuth . This allows the OAuth-using system to authenticate users, and the Bitpoint Latam  Exchange accepts that user based on the values for *AccessCode* and *Email*. This avoids the necessity of a double login.

### Request

```json
{
    "AccessCode"= "",
    "Email"= ""
}
```
Note the equal signs rather than colons. The *OAuth* protocol requires equal signs.
