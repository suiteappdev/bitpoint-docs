## GetTradesHistory

**Category:** User<br />
**Permissions:** Operator, Trading<br />
**Call Type:** Synchronous

Retrieves a list of trades for a specified account, order ID, user, instrument, or starting and ending time stamp. The returned list begins at start index *i,* where *i* is an integer identifying a specific trade in reverse order; that is, the most recent trade has an index of 0. “Depth” is the count of trades to report backwards from *StartIndex*. 

Users with Trading permission can retrieve trade history for accounts with which they are associated; users with Operator permission can retrieve trade history for any account.

<aside class="warning"><strong>Caution</strong>: You must coordinate *StartIndex*, *Depth*, *StartTimeStamp*, and *EndTimeStamp* to retrieve the historical information you need. As the diagram shows, it is possible to specify values (for example, *EndTimeStamp* and *Depth*) that can exclude information you may want (the red areas).</aside>


<aside class="notice"><strong>Note</strong>: In this call, “Depth” refers not to the depth of the order book, but to the count of trades to report. The owner of the trading venue determines how long to retain order history before archiving.</aside>
