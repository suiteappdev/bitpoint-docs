## AddAccount

**Category:** System<br />**Permissions:** Operator<br />**Call Type:** Synchronous

Creates a new account on the Bitpoint Latam  Exchange. The Exchange differentiates between *user* and *account.* A user has access to the Exchange by logging in; a user trades on the Exchange through an account (much like a bank account).
