## GetAccounts

**Category:** System<br />**Permissions:** Operator<br />**Call Type:** Synchronous

Returns an array of account information for the specified Order Management System, controlled by the values of *StartIndex* and *Limit.* 

You can optionally include the key-value pair *RequestedKeys*, which currently can return those accounts that include values for *firmId* and *firmName* (some accounts may not include values for these keys, and would not be returned). *StartIndex* and *Limit* still are used and apply when returning accounts based on *firmId* and *firmName.* 

### Request

```json
{
    "OMSId": 1,
    "StartIndex": 0,
    "Limit": 100,
    "RequestedKeys": [ "firmid", "FirmName", "fsRegId" ]
}
```

| Key           | Value                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| OMSId         | **Integer.** The ID of the Order Management System on which the accounts operate. |
| StartIndex    | **integer.** The account ID at which to begin returning account information. The returns from the call begin at the value of *StartIndex* and move toward higher numbers. For example, if you have 100 accounts on an Exchange numbered 1&ndash;100 and set the value of *StartIndex* to 50, the accounts returned will be numbered 50 and higher. |
| Limit         | **integer.** The number of accounts to return in the Response array. For example, if you set the value of *Limit* to 50, you will return up to 50 accounts (you may return fewer if there are fewer accounts to return). |
| RequestedKeys | **array of strings.** OPTIONAL Tells the system to return accounts that include values for the keys *firmId* and *firmName* (some accounts may not include values for these keys). In the current version of Bitpoint Latam  Exchange, *firmId*, *firmName* and *fsRegId* are the only keys that can be used in this way. fsRegId key values will be in *firmId*. |
