| Key                    | Value                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| omsId                  | **integer.** The ID of the Order Management System where the account operates. |
| accountId              | **integer.** The ID of the account whose margin state is being returned. |
| normalizedProductId    | **integer.** In order to facilitate calculating the values for *buyingPower* and *maintenanceRequirement,* the Bitpoint Latam  Exchange rolls an account's complete holdings together into a "normalized product" &mdash; a concept product incorporating the value of all products held by the account. The Exchange assigns an ID to the "normalized product." The value of *normalizedProductId* is this ID.  |
| buyingPower            | **real.** The value of *buyingPower* is the total value of product held by the account plus the value of all available margin across all products held by the account.                |
| maintenanceRequirement | **real.** An amount required to be held in the account to qualify for the account's current available margin. A low value for *maintenanceRequirement* will result in a margin call.  |
