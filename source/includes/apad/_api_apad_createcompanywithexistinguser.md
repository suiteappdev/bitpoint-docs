## CreateCompanyWithExistingUser

**Category:** APAD<br />**Permissions:** PlatformAdmin<br />**Call Type:** Asynchronous

Creates a new company and assigns an existing user as the company administrator (CoAdmin). There can be more than one company administrator assigned to a company. The user must already exist on the Bitpoint Latam  Exchange, but can be any user. 

This call is similar to **CreateCoAdmin**, where a new user is created and assigned to an existing company; with **CreateCompanyWithExistingUser**, the user exists, but the company is created.

<aside class="notice"><strong>Note:Â </strong>Essentially, <strong>CreateCompanyWithExitingUser</strong> appends a user name to the <strong>CreateCompany</strong> call.</aside>
