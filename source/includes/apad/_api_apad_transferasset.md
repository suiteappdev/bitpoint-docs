## TransferAsset

**Category:** APAD<br />**Permissions:** PlatformAdmin, CompanyAdmin<br />**Call Type:** Asynchronous

Transfers an asset from one account to another account on the Bitpoint Latam  Exchange. Both accounts must already exist. On the exchange, an "account" is different from a "user," and both are different from a "company."

The **TransferAsset** call is used to grant assets from a company to a user. The "from" name must be an APAD company name.

A user with CompanyAdmin permission can transfer an asset only between accounts or users associated with the company of the CompanyAdmin; the CompanyAdmin cannot transfer an asset to an unassociated account, for example. A PlatformAdmin can transfer an asset between any two accounts and users.
