| Permissions                    | **array.** Returns a string array of permissions that this user currently holds. The permissions are drawn from:<br />Enabled<br />PlatformAdmin<br />Investor<br />MarketMaker<br />CompanyAdmin<br />CompanyShareholder<br />CompanyAgent<br /><br />This is not an enumerated list. Because the user is being created (and has no prior permissions or roles), the *Permissions* array should return only *CompanyShareholder* &mdash; the permission that is being assigned by the call. |
| AssetNamesByCompanyName        | **array.** DEPRECATED Returns a string array of key-value pairs that consist of a company name and the name of an asset provided by the company.  This user is being created, but also being named as a company shareholder of a specific company. *AssetNamesByCompanyName* should return a list of assets provided to the exchange by the company. |
| OnExchangeBalancesByAssetName  | **array.** Returns an array of key-value pairs consisting of an asset name (usually one returned in the *AssetNamesByCompanyName* field) and a number representing the amount of that asset belonging to the company and currently available on the exchange. |
| OffExchangeBalancesByAssetName | **array.** DEPRECATED Returns an array of key-value pairs consisting of an asset name (usually one returned in the *AssetNamesByCompanyName* field) and a number representing the amount of the asset belonging to the company and *not* currently available on the exchange. In current implementations, usually returns an empty array. |
| RoleNamesByCompanyName         | **array.** Returns an array of key-value pairs consisting of a company name and the name of a role that this user has been given for this company. Since this is a new user who has been given the company shareholder role by this call, this field should return the company name and *CoShareholder*. |
| UserName                       | **string.** The name of the new user being assigned the role of shareholder. |
| Email                          | **string.** The email address of the new user being assigned the role of shareholder. |
| ExternalId                     | **string.** The Bitpoint Latam  user ID of the new user, returned as a string. |
